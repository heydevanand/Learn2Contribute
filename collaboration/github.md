# Getting Started

- What is GitHub?
  - GitHub is a platform for version control that helps teams manage and track changes to their projects.
  - It provides a centralized location for storing code, documents, and other project-related files.
  - GitHub makes collaboration easy by allowing multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously, track changes, and communicate effectively.

- Benefits of Using GitHub
  - Discuss the advantages of using GitHub, such as version control, collaboration, project management, and community support.
  - Mention how it can improve code quality, streamline development, and enhance transparency in your project.

# Creating a GitHub Account
Process of creating a GitHub account in more detail:

- Visit GitHub: Go to the GitHub website in your web browser.

- Sign Up: Click on the "Sign up" button to begin the registration process.

- Username and Email: Choose a username for your account and enter your email address. Your username will be your identity on GitHub, so choose it carefully.

- Password: Create a secure password to protect your account. GitHub will provide feedback on the password's strength.

- CAPTCHA: Complete any CAPTCHA or verification steps if prompted.

- Email Verification: Verify your email address by following the link sent to your email inbox.

- Choose a Plan: GitHub offers free plans for public repositories. Select the plan that best suits your needs.

- Welcome to GitHub: After completing the registration process, you'll be welcomed to GitHub.

- Profile Setup: Add a profile picture and provide some information about yourself. This step is optional but can make it easier for others to recognize you in the GitHub community.

- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): For added security, consider setting up two-factor authentication. This provides an extra layer of protection for your account.

# Setting Up Git
Git is a version control system that interacts with GitHub.

- Install Git: Refer to Git Installation section [Git Guide](/version-control/git.md).

- Configure Git: Git needs to be configured with your GitHub credentials. To set the username and email that will be associated with your Git commits:

  ```shell
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  ```
- SSH Key (Optional): For added security and ease of authentication, consider generating an SSH key and linking it to your GitHub account. Provide instructions for creating an SSH key pair and adding the public key to your GitHub account.
