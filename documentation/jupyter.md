To create a new code cell, click the "+" button in the notebook's toolbar, select "Code," and start coding. To execute the code in a cell, use the "Run" button or press Shift+Enter.

Jupyter Lab's support for Markdown and Code cells makes it a powerful tool for combining code and documentation in a single environment. You can provide explanations, instructions, and visualizations alongside your code, making it an ideal platform for data analysis, research, and programming projects.

## Markdown and Text

### Markdown Basics
Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use markup language that allows you to format text in your Jupyter Lab documents. Familiarizing yourself with Markdown syntax is essential for creating well-structured and visually appealing content. Here are some of the Markdown basics you should be aware of:

- **Headers:** Use hashtags (`#`) to create headers. The number of hashtags determines the header level. For example, `#` creates a level-1 header, while `##` creates a level-2 header.

- **Lists:** Create ordered (numbered) or unordered (bulleted) lists using simple syntax. For an unordered list, use asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens (`*`, `+`, `-`) as list markers. For ordered lists, use numbers followed by periods.

- **Links:** To include hyperlinks in your Markdown text, use square brackets for the link text and parentheses for the URL. For example: `[OpenAI's website](https://www.openai.com)`.

- **Images:** Embed images in your Markdown cells by using an exclamation mark followed by square brackets for alt text and parentheses for the image URL. Example: `![Alt Text](image_url.jpg)`.

- **Emphasis:** Add emphasis to text using asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`). Use one for italics and two for bold text. For italics, surround the text with `*` or `_`. For bold, use `**` or `__`.

- **Blockquotes:** Create blockquotes by adding a `>` before the quoted text. This is useful for highlighting quotes or important information.

- **Code and Syntax Highlighting:** Display inline code by wrapping text in backticks (\`). For code blocks, use triple backticks (```) and specify the programming language for syntax highlighting.

- Refer to our [Markdown Guide](/documentation/markdown.md) to learn more about Markdown.

### Math and Equations
Jupyter Lab supports mathematical notation and equations using LaTeX syntax. LaTeX is a powerful typesetting system for mathematical and scientific documents. To include mathematical equations in your Markdown cells, you can use LaTeX notation. Here's how to get started with math and equations in Markdown:

- **Inline Math:** Enclose LaTeX math expressions with dollar signs (\$). For example, to render the equation `E=mc^2` inline, you can write it as `\(E=mc^2\)`.

- **Math Blocks:** To create larger math blocks or equations, use double dollar signs (\$\$) to enclose your LaTeX expressions. For instance, to display the quadratic formula, you can write:

  ```latex
  $$
  x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
  $$
  ```
- Math Environments: You can use various math environments, such as align, equation, and align*, for more complex equations and alignment. These are particularly useful for multi-line equations.

- Symbols and Operators: LaTeX provides a vast array of symbols and operators for mathematical notation. You can use commands like \sqrt, \frac, \int, and many more to create complex mathematical expressions.

- Math Macros: Define custom macros or shortcuts for frequently used mathematical notations to simplify your equations.

With Markdown and LaTeX, you can create rich and expressive text and mathematical content in your Jupyter Lab documents, making it an ideal platform for documenting data analysis, scientific research, and technical projects.
