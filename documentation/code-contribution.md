- Clone a Repository: Use this command to clone your forked repository to your local machine:

  ```markdown
  git clone your-fork-repository-URL

- Create a New Branch: Create a new branch for your content contribution:

  ```markdown
  git checkout -b your-branch-name

- Check Current Branch: Verify the branch you're on:

  ```markdown
  git branch

- Switch Branch: Switch between branches:

  ```markdown
  git checkout branch-name

- Fetch and Pull Changes: Get the latest changes from the remote repository:

  ```markdown
  git fetch origin
  git pull origin branch-name

- View Status: Check the status of your local repository:

  ```markdown
  git status

- Undo Changes: Discard changes in your working directory:
