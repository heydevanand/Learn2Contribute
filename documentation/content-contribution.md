## Content Quality

We value high-quality content that aligns with the goals of our project. When creating content, please consider the following:

## Writing Guidelines

To maintain consistency and clarity in our content, follow these writing guidelines:

- Avoid jargon and use plain language where possible.

- Organize content with headings and subheadings for readability.

- Provide examples, code snippets, and illustrations where relevant.

- Use an inclusive and welcoming tone to address a diverse audience.

- Cite sources when referencing external content.

## Markdown Best Practices

We use markdown to create our Content. When creating content in Markdown, consider these best practices:

- **Headers**: Use headers (e.g., `#`, `##`, `###`) for section titles and subheadings.

- **Lists**: Use bullet points (`-`) for unordered lists and numbers for ordered lists.

- **Links**: Use `[link text](URL)` format for creating hyperlinks.

- **Images**: Embed images using `![alt text](image URL)`.

- **Code Blocks**: Format code blocks with triple backticks (```) and specify the code language for syntax highlighting.

- **Emphasis**: Use `*italic*` or `**bold**` for emphasis.

- **Tables**: Create tables using pipes (`|`) and hyphens (`-`).

For a more detailed guide on Markdown formatting, please refer to our [Markdown Best Practices Document](documentation/markdown.md) in our repository. If you want to use anyother tool to create content please discuss regarding it in GitHub Discussions before starting your work.
